# Building-LLM-implementations-with-OpenAI-API

## Course1: ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers

In this course, you will learn how to use a large language model (LLM) to quickly build new and powerful applications.  Using the OpenAI API, you’ll be able to quickly build capabilities that learn to innovate and create value in ways that were cost-prohibitive, highly technical, or simply impossible before now. This short course taught by Isa Fulford (OpenAI) and Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI) will describe how LLMs work, provide best practices for prompt engineering, and show how LLM APIs can be used in applications for a variety of tasks, including:

- Summarizing (e.g., summarizing user reviews for brevity)
- Inferring (e.g., sentiment classification, topic extraction)
- Transforming text (e.g., translation, spelling & grammar correction)
- Expanding (e.g., automatically writing emails)
  
In addition, you’ll learn two key principles for writing effective prompts, how to systematically engineer good prompts, and also learn to build a custom chatbot.

## Course2: Building Systems with the ChatGPT API

In this deeplearning.ai course, you will learn how to automate complex workflows using chain calls to a large language model. Unlock new development capabilities and improve your efficiency in this brand new short course.

You’ll build:

- Chains of prompts that interact with the completions of prior prompts.
- Systems where Python code interacts with both completions and new prompts.
- A customer service chatbot using all the techniques from this course.

You’ll learn how to apply these skills to practical scenarios, including classifying user queries to a chat agent’s response, evaluating user queries for safety, and processing tasks for chain-of-thought, multi-step reasoning. 

## Course3: Langchain for LLM Application Development and Chatting with your Own Data

### Combination of dual deeplearning.ai short courses, LangChain for LLM Application Development and LangChain: Chat With Your Data! 

The first short course (instructed by the creator of LangChain Harrison Chase as well as Andrew Ng) will vastly expand the possibilities for leveraging powerful language models, where you can now create incredibly robust applications in a matter of hours. 

You will gain essential skills in expanding the use cases and capabilities of language models in application development using the LangChain framework.

In this course you will learn and get experience with the following topics:

- Models, Prompts and Parsers: calling LLMs, providing prompts and parsing the response
- Memories for LLMs: memories to store conversations and manage limited context space
- Chains: creating sequences of operations
- Question Answering over Documents: apply LLMs to your proprietary data and use case requirements
- Agents: explore the powerful emerging development of LLM as reasoning agents.
  
At the end of the course, you will have a model that can serve as a starting point for your own exploration of diffusion models for your applications.

The second short course delves into two main topics: (1) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a common LLM application that retrieves contextual documents from an external dataset, and (2) a guide to building a chatbot that responds to queries based on the content of your documents, rather than the information it has learned in training.

You’ll learn about:

- Document Loading: Learn the fundamentals of data loading and discover over 80 unique loaders LangChain provides to access diverse data sources, including audio and video.
- Document Splitting: Discover the best practices and considerations for splitting data.
- Vector stores and embeddings: Dive into the concept of embeddings and explore vector store integrations within LangChain.
- Retrieval: Grasp advanced techniques for accessing and indexing data in the vector store, enabling you to retrieve the most relevant information beyond semantic queries.
- Question Answering: Build a one-pass question-answering solution.
- Chat: Learn how to track and select pertinent information from conversations and data sources, as you build your own chatbot using LangChain.
